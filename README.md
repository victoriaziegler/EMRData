# EMRData

The purpose of this project is to showcase GraphQL understanding while creating Electronic Medical Record data for various hospitals and their patients.

## MVP

This project is able to show all patients in the database, and get specific patients based on search criteria such as age range, specific age, name, or hospital they are associated with to make it easier to find patients that fit your clinical research needs. New patients and hospitals are able to be added to the database.

## Running the project

After cloning the repository from gitlab to your local computer, please use the following command to run the project. 
* npm run DevStart

The graphiql interface can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/graphql to test and manipulate the data.
